# Implementation Plan: Runtime Settings CLI Validation Proof

**Branch**: `codex/runtime-settings-cli-validation-proof-admission` |
**Date**: 2026-05-18 | **Spec**: `spec.md`

**Input**: Feature specification from
`.specify/specs/runtime-settings-cli-validation-proof-v1/spec.md`

## Summary

Import and lock the runtime settings CLI validation proof artifact contract for
the MIT clean-room Spec Kit authority. The feature defines the next narrow
implementation admission unit after validation readback:
`IAU-runtime-settings-cli-validation-proof-artifact-v1`.

This plan admits requirements, Spec Kit artifacts, admission records, preflight
records, validation script coverage, and Issue #55 as the public admission
surface. Issue #57 implements the admitted proof artifact contract for
T009-T012 only.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Node.js 22 for current repository gates. Future
implementation may use JavaScript modules and node:test after the IAU handoff.

**Primary Dependencies**: None for import/spec/admission. Future implementation
should use pure data contracts and existing MIT validation readback helpers
where publicly available.

**Storage**: Public requirements files, Spec Kit artifacts, public admission
records, and future public validation proof JSON/issue-body contracts.

**Testing**: `npm test` validates import packet shape, Spec Kit artifact
presence, package identity, admission state, redaction, traceability, and the
clean-room boundary.

**Target Platform**: Public MIT repository workflow. No Windows desktop,
LabVIEWCLI, Docker, VSIX packaging, Marketplace, compare execution, or
live-session proof environment is required for this admission.

**Project Type**: Spec Kit-first public requirements authority with clean-room
implementation gated by IAUs.

**Constraints**: No implementation source is copied from other product lines.
Marketplace publication remains disabled. Proof artifact admission does not
imply interactive selection, compare execution, runtime execution,
live-session proof, packaging, or publishing admission.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- Clean-room requirements authority: PASS. The plan imports requirements and
  writes public Spec Kit/admission artifacts only.
- Spec Kit before implementation: PASS. No runnable source is added.
- Immutable imported requirement IDs: PASS. Imported IDs are preserved without
  redefining source semantics.
- Public evidence without private leakage: PASS. Redaction and clean-room scans
  are repository gates.
- Marketplace disabled until governed: PASS. This feature records no
  publication workflow.

### Source Code

No product source is changed by this admission branch.

## Phase 0: Research

The governed bridge-readiness record split validation proof artifacts from
no-argument interactive selection, compare execution, LabVIEWCLI execution,
Docker execution, live-session proof, packaging, and Marketplace behavior
because proof artifact generation can be tested as a pure contract over
validation facts.

## Phase 1: Design And Contracts

Contracts to preserve for the admitted IAU:

- The proof JSON preserves supplied validation readback facts.
- Stable runtime error, proof, and implementation status fields are retained.
- Secret-like environment values are redacted from public output.
- The issue-body content is deterministic and targets the MIT public
  authority.
- Missing or unsupported proof facts fail closed.
- No runtime execution is started.

## Validation Gates

- `npm test`
- `npm run check`
- `git diff --check`
- Public redaction scan over this feature's import, Spec Kit, admission, and
  guidance artifacts
- Bridge artifact validation for `runtime-settings-cli-validation-proof-v1`

## Implementation Admission

`IAU-runtime-settings-cli-validation-proof-artifact-v1` is implemented for
T009-T012 only through Issue #57 after its preflight record passed.

Implementation must not start T013-T018. Future implementation outside this IAU
requires a separate named IAU, public admission records, and a preflight record
with `status: "pass"`.
