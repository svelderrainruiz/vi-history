# VI History

`svelderrainruiz/vi-history` is the MIT-licensed Spec Kit implementation
authority for VI History.

This repository starts from requirements and Spec Kit artifacts, not from copied
extension source. The initial baseline imported the
`runtime-contract-host-provider-v1` requirements slice and completed admitted
runtime-contract IAUs through proof intake. The current public Spec Kit import
adds `installed-user-observation-public-surface-v1`, with
`IAU-installed-user-observation-model-v1` admitted for T009-T013 only.

## Authority

- Package name: `vi-history`
- Display name: `VI History`
- Publisher: `svelderrainruiz`
- Extension ID: `svelderrainruiz.vi-history`
- License: MIT
- Version: `0.1.0`
- Marketplace publication: disabled; future enablement requires a later ADR

## Branch Flow

- `develop` is the integration branch for bootstrap and feature work.
- `main` is the public baseline branch.
- Feature branches target `develop` first, then `develop` promotes to `main`
  after validation is green.

## Current Status

- #1 bootstrapped the MIT Spec Kit authority.
- #2 imported `runtime-contract-host-provider-v1`.
- #3 locked the Spec Kit feature spec, plan, and tasks.
- #4 completed admitted runtime-contract IAUs through proof intake.
- #5 keeps Marketplace publication disabled until a later ADR admits it.
- #25 imported `installed-user-observation-public-surface-v1` as a public
  requirements/spec baseline.
- #27 is the public handoff for
  `IAU-installed-user-observation-model-v1`.

The current admission ledgers are:

- `docs/requirements/admissions/runtime-contract-host-provider-v1.json`
- `docs/requirements/admissions/installed-user-observation-public-surface-v1.json`

The current admitted implementation unit is
`IAU-installed-user-observation-model-v1`, scoped only to T009-T013.

Future code work outside T009-T013 must start from a new public bridge
admission record before Copilot or local implementation begins.

The Marketplace posture is recorded in
`docs/decisions/ADR-001-marketplace-publication-disabled.md` and summarized in
`docs/governance/marketplace-posture.md`.

## Validation

Run:

```bash
npm test
```

The current gates validate import packet shape, Spec Kit artifact presence,
package identity, admission state, redaction, traceability, and the clean-room
boundary.
